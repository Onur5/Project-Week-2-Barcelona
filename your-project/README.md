## Project Description
The general aim of this project is to analyse of the  air pollution of Barcelona. Among others, the questions regarding the spots with the worst/best air quality and the change of air quality over time are adressed in this work.

Pollution is not only a trendy topic due to the 'ecological shift' of the european politics recently, but also important due to the increasing risks for each individual caused by it. 

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions

Has Barcelona a good air quality?
Which are the streets or spots in Barcelona with the worst air quality? Moreover, which is the best spot in terms of air quality?
Does the air quality indexes change during the day? Is there any significant difference during daily hours? What happens at night?

Questions where we need more databases:
Has the air quality any relation to the weather conditions? (temperature, rain, humidity, wind)
Which is the neighborhood with the highest rate of air pollution/inhabitant?
Has air pollution increased from 2017 to 2018 and 2019, average per month?
